# 3D Spinning Cube for Casio Calculators

## Introduction

This project brings a 3D spinning cube visualization to Casio calculators, using the `gint` library. The program allows users to interactively zoom in and out of the cube view using the `Shift` and `Alpha` keys.

## Requirements

- Casio Graphing Calculator (fx-9750GII, fx-9860GII, Graph 75+ E, fx-CG50, or similar models compatible with `gint`)
- A computer to transfer the program to the calculator
- The `gint` library for Casio calculators

## Installation

1. **Prepare your calculator:** Ensure your Casio calculator is compatible with `gint`. Refer to the `gint` documentation for details on compatibility and preparation steps.

2. **Install `gint`:** Follow the instructions provided in the `gint` documentation to install the library.

3. **Download the 3D Cube Program:** Download the latest release of the 3D Spinning Cube program from this repository's Releases page.

4. **Compile the program:** Compile the program using the gint librarys for your model of calculator.

5. **Transfer the program:** Use FA-124 (for fx-9750GII and fx-9860GII models) or Casio's recommended software for your calculator model to transfer the downloaded program file to your calculator.

## Usage

- **Launch the program:** Navigate to the program list on your calculator, find the 3D Cube program, and execute it.
- **Interact with the cube:**
  - **Rotate:** The cube rotates automatically. Enjoy the view as it spins.
  - **Zoom In:** Press the `Shift` key to zoom in and get a closer look at the cube.
  - **Zoom Out:** Press the `Alpha` key to zoom out and view the cube from a distance.
